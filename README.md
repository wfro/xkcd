See the exercise at [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/287/)

To run:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:wfro/xkcd.git
cd xkcd
ruby run.rb
```

You can optionally pass another file to the ruby interpreter (use absolute filepaths if the file is outside of the xkcd directory). 

```shell
ruby run.rb another_menu.txt
```
